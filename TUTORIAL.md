What you might encounter when using the Legacy survay viewer:
**Saturated sensor and planets?
that’s a littel place where our tiling patterns leaves only one exposure of the sky – a particularly noisy one, looks like!
https://discuss.legacysurvey.org/t/borg-cube/4227

"The stars are so bright that they saturate the CCD detectors, and then it gets flagged by the processing software, the colors may get messed up. If you flip over to the Legacy Surveys DR10 layer, you’ll see that the bright stars look a bit different because we handle saturation differently.

As spcgoat says, you can’t see planets in these images. With these cameras, all stars are tiny fractions of a pixel across; they only look extended because of blurring by the atmosphere."

and those are “ghost images” coming from the very bright star in the center of the image. A ghost happens when light bounces around in the detector (eg bounces off a lens rather than passing through the lens). More explanation here,

** Tidal tails and galacitc arms 
A tidal tail and a spiral arm are both structures that can be seen in galaxies, but they have different origins and characteristics.
Tidal tails are formed as a result of gravitational interactions between two galaxies. 
When two galaxies pass close to each other, their gravitational forces can cause the stars and gas in each galaxy to be pulled out and form a long, extended structure called a tidal tail. 
Tidal tails are typically narrow, elongated structures that trail away from the main body of a galaxy.
Spiral arms, on the other hand, are a characteristic feature of spiral galaxies. 
They are regions of intense star formation that are located along the arms of the spiral galaxy. 
Spiral arms are typically wider and more pronounced than tidal tails and are characterised by a higher density of stars and gas.
In summary, while both tidal tails and spiral arms can be seen in galaxies, tidal tails are the result of interactions between galaxies, while spiral arms are a natural feature of spiral galaxies.

**Hoag's object/ Collisional Ring Galaxies and ringed galaxies
“Ring galaxies are believed to represent a special case of a collision between two galaxies, in which one of the galaxies impacts and passes through the center of another disk system (e.g. Lynds & Toomre 1976). 
Although rare, this kind of low orbital-angular-momentum collision leads to a recognizable structure, namely a luminous blue star-forming ring (Appleton & Marston 1997), which should be easily identifiable even at moderate redshift. Indeed, Lavery et al. (dy1996) have used this fact, and their relative rarity at low-redshift, to conclude that rings (and therefore presumably all collisions) are over-represented in deep HST fields.”

More about the different image sources:
- Legacy Surveys DR10 images
**The Legacy Surveys DR10 images are high-quality astronomical images of the sky, covering nearly one-third of the entire celestial sphere. These images were taken using specially designed telescopes and cameras, and they capture light across a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet to infrared. The DR10 release represents the latest data from the Legacy Surveys project and includes improved image quality and coverage compared to previous releases. These images are a valuable resource for astronomers and anyone interested in exploring the wonders of the cosmos.**

- unWISE W1/W2 NEO7
**The unWISE W1/W2 NEO7 images are a set of high-resolution astronomical images of the near-Earth object (NEO) population, captured by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) spacecraft. These images cover two infrared wavelengths, W1 and W2, and are designed to help identify and track potentially hazardous asteroids and other objects in the NEO population. The unWISE images are created using advanced image processing techniques, which remove artifacts and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. They provide a valuable resource for astronomers and other researchers studying the NEO population and the dynamics of the Solar System.**

**The DES DR1 (Dark Energy Survey Data Release 1) images are a set of high-quality astronomical images of the southern sky, captured by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) project. These images cover a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet to infrared, and are designed to help researchers understand the nature of dark energy and the structure of the universe. The DR1 release includes images of over 5,000 square degrees of the sky, along with catalogs of galaxies, stars, and other astronomical objects. These images are a valuable resource for astronomers and anyone interested in exploring the mysteries of the cosmos.**

- GALEX
**The GALEX (Galaxy Evolution Explorer) images are a set of ultraviolet (UV) astronomical images of the sky, captured by NASA's GALEX spacecraft. These images provide a unique view of the cosmos, as they capture light in a wavelength range that is not visible to the human eye. The GALEX images are designed to help astronomers study the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time, as well as the properties of stars, black holes, and other astrophysical objects. They have also been used to study the structure of the Milky Way and the properties of interstellar dust. These images are a valuable resource for researchers studying the many mysteries of the universe.**

- H alpha map
**The H-alpha map is a map of the sky that shows the distribution of hydrogen gas that is emitting light at the wavelength of 656.28 nm, known as the H-alpha line. This wavelength is in the red part of the visible spectrum, and the H-alpha line is a powerful diagnostic tool for studying the properties of interstellar gas in the Milky Way and other galaxies. The H-alpha map is created by combining observations from a variety of telescopes and instruments, including narrowband filters and spectrographs. The map can reveal the locations of star-forming regions, supernova remnants, and other astrophysical objects that emit H-alpha radiation. The H-alpha map is a valuable resource for astronomers studying the structure and evolution of galaxies, as well as the processes that govern the formation of stars and planetary systems.**

- HSC DR2
**The HSC DR2 (Hyper Suprime-Cam Data Release 2) images are a set of high-quality astronomical images of the sky, captured by the Hyper Suprime-Cam instrument on the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii. These images cover a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet to near-infrared, and provide a detailed view of the structure and properties of galaxies, stars, and other astronomical objects. The DR2 release includes images of over 3000 square degrees of the sky, along with catalogs of galaxies, stars, and other astrophysical objects. These images are a valuable resource for astronomers and anyone interested in exploring the mysteries of the cosmos. They are particularly useful for studying the large-scale structure of the universe and the properties of dark matter and dark energy.**

- SDSS
**The SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) images are a set of high-quality astronomical images of the sky, captured by a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope in New Mexico, USA. These images cover a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet to near-infrared, and provide a detailed view of the structure and properties of galaxies, stars, and other astronomical objects. The SDSS images have been used to create comprehensive maps of the distribution of galaxies in the universe, as well as to study the properties of dark matter, supermassive black holes, and other astrophysical phenomena. In addition to the images themselves, the SDSS project has also released catalogs of astronomical objects and spectroscopic data, providing a rich resource for researchers studying the cosmos. The SDSS images are widely used in astronomy and have contributed significantly to our understanding of the universe.**

- SFD dust map
**The SFD (Schlegel, Finkbeiner, Davis) dust map is a widely used 2D map of the Milky Way's interstellar dust distribution, created using data from the COBE and IRAS satellites. The map provides a measure of the total amount of dust along each line of sight in the sky, which is useful for correcting for the effects of dust extinction in astronomical observations, such as in determining the properties of distant galaxies and measuring the cosmic microwave background radiation. The map is often represented using a color scale, with regions of higher dust density appearing as darker colors.**

- VLASS 1.2
**The VLASS (Very Large Array Sky Survey) 1.2 map is a radio frequency map of the sky at a frequency of 3 GHz, covering about 3/4 of the entire sky. It was created using data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, USA, and is one of the most sensitive and detailed radio frequency maps of the sky to date. The map is designed to enable astronomers to study a wide variety of objects, such as galaxies, quasars, and supernova remnants, at radio wavelengths and to search for new radio sources. It is expected to be a valuable resource for a wide range of astronomical research, from studying the evolution of galaxies to mapping the distribution of dark matter in the universe.**
