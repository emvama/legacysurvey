** Tidal tails and galacitc arms 
A tidal tail and a spiral arm are both structures that can be seen in galaxies, but they have different origins and characteristics.

Tidal tails are formed as a result of gravitational interactions between two galaxies. 
When two galaxies pass close to each other, their gravitational forces can cause the stars and gas in each galaxy to be pulled out and form a long, extended structure called a tidal tail. 
Tidal tails are typically narrow, elongated structures that trail away from the main body of a galaxy.

Spiral arms, on the other hand, are a characteristic feature of spiral galaxies. 
They are regions of intense star formation that are located along the arms of the spiral galaxy. 
Spiral arms are typically wider and more pronounced than tidal tails and are characterised by a higher density of stars and gas.

In summary, while both tidal tails and spiral arms can be seen in galaxies, tidal tails are the result of interactions between galaxies, while spiral arms are a natural feature of spiral galaxies.

Special cases:
Collisional Ring Galaxies
“Ring galaxies are believed to represent a special case of a collision between two galaxies, in which one of the galaxies impacts and passes through the center of another disk system (e.g. Lynds & Toomre 1976). 
Although rare, this kind of low orbital-angular-momentum collision leads to a recognizable structure, namely a luminous blue star-forming ring (Appleton & Marston 1997), which should be easily identifiable even at moderate redshift. Indeed, Lavery et al. (dy1996) have used this fact, and their relative rarity at low-redshift, to conclude that rings (and therefore presumably all collisions) are over-represented in deep HST fields.”

** Gravitational lensing 

** Plantes?
"What’s happening here is that these stars are so bright that they saturate the CCD detectors, and then it gets flagged by the processing software and the colors may get messed up. If you flip over to the Legacy Surveys DR10 layer, you’ll see that the bright stars look a bit different because we handle saturation differently.
As spcgoat says, you can’t see planets in these images. With these cameras, all stars are tiny fractions of a pixel across; they only look extended because of blurring by the atmosphere."

Saturated sensor
that’s a littel place where our tiling patterns leaves only one exposure of the sky – a particularly noisy one, looks like!

and those are “ghost images” coming from the very bright star in the center of the image. A ghost happens when light bounces around in the detector (eg bounces off a lens rather than passing through the lens). More explanation here,
